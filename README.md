Description: Color organ schematic for falstad circuit simulator.
    Created as a part of a group project in my university. All the filters are
    single supply amplifying filters

    The high pass filter model is from a TI datasheet:
    https://mil.ufl.edu/4924/docs/TI_SingleSupply_OpAmp.pdf (pg 13)

    The band- and low pass active filters are made based on the model from a
    website: https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_7.html
    (Inverting Band Pass Filter Circuit)

    The folder corr_components contains circuits with corresponding components
    to what we had as an option in the project subject.


    If you want to learn more about our project development there is a report 
    available (though is in estonian): (Is left to do)
